description: Bosch m_can CAN-FD controller

compatible: "atmel,samv71-mcan"

include: bosch-mcan.yaml

properties:
    peripheral-id:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        The peripheral identifier is required for the control of the peripheral
        interrupt with the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller and control of
        the peripheral clock with the Power Management Controller.

    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: true
      description: |
        PIO configuration for CANRX/CANTX. We expect that the phandles will
        reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will have a nodelabel that
        matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and be of the form
        p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.
